	// ── download (HPS image write) port ────────────────────────────────────
	// ★★★ ROOT CAUSE of the "mounting a floppy bombs the guest" regression
	// (found 2026-08-18, branch cpu-icache). The download used to ride the
	// CPU's own oe/we/addr/din nets, muxed in for the dioBusControl slot
	// (`download_cycle` in MacLC.sv / verilator/sim.v). That was sound under
	// the OLD slot machine, where _ramOE/_ramWE were gated on cpuBusControl —
	// the exact complement of dioBusControl — so a CPU request and a download
	// write could not coexist. Phase C (f13d936) deleted that gating to make
	// the CPU request a LEVEL held for the whole AS-low window, and the level
	// now spans the download's slot. Two failures followed, both fatal:
	//   1. While the mux pointed at the download, the CPU's request was
	//      INVISIBLE here, and the download's posted-write ack landed in
	//      `cpu_done` — which is the CPU's DTACK. When the slot ended and the
	//      CPU's still-asserted `oe` came back, `!(oe||we)` was never true, so
	//      cpu_done never cleared: the CPU completed a read it had never
	//      issued and latched the PREVIOUS access's cpu_dout. Executing that
	//      stale word is the "illegal instruction" / "coprocessor not
	//      installed" bomb seen on every floppy mount since Phase C.
	//   2. In slots where dio_write was low, oe/we were forced to 0, CLEARING
	//      a legitimate in-flight CPU cpu_done mid-access.
	// The ROM download at boot was immune only because MacLC.sv holds the CPU
	// in reset while (dio_download && dio_index==0) — which is why booting
	// always worked and only mounting broke.
	// This port restores the mutual exclusion STRUCTURALLY: the download has
	// its own request, its own frozen address/data, and never writes cpu_done.
	input               dl_req,     // LEVEL: a download word is pending (= ioctl_wait)
	input               dl_slot,    // its bus slot (dioBusControl) — gating the START
	                                // here keeps the download to one word per bus
	                                // round, exactly the pre-Phase-C rate, so the
	                                // CPU/download bandwidth split is unchanged
	input  [23:0]       dl_addr,    // SDRAM word address for that word
	input  [15:0]       dl_din,     // the word
	output reg          dl_ack,     // LEVEL, not a pulse: clk_64 is 2x clk_sys, so a
	                                // one-tick pulse is not reliably sampleable over
	                                // there. Held from issue until dl_req drops, i.e.
	                                // until the clk_sys side has seen it and cleared
	                                // ioctl_wait. Keying the release on the SLOT

	                                // hang the download when the two just missed.

	// ── PDS Ethernet guest-RAM DMA port (rtl/pds/pds_enet.sv, Phase 3) ─────

	// bus leaves plenty), and its bandwidth need is tiny (10BASE-T peak =
