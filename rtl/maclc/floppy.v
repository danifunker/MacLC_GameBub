/* Synchronous 8-bit replica of 3.5 inch floppy disk drive.

	Differences from the true floppy interace at the Mac's DB-19 port:
	True interface has a writeReq control line, only 1-bit readData and writeData, and no clk.
	True interface does not have newByteReady signal. Instead the IWM must watch the data in bit and synchronize with it to
	   determine the timing and framing of bytes.
